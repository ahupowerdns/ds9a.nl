        <H1>Startup &amp; Innovation Library</h1>
        <p>
          I care a lot about innovation. Given today's industrial architecture, that means I care a lot about startups, since large corporations are now mostly process oriented, leaving actual innovation to smaller organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Partially on request of Yes!Delft, the TU Delft startup incubator, I have created this 'Library' page with links to various articles relevant to innovation &amp; startup life. I also include some of my own work among the links.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know very little about the 'business to consumer' business, so if you are looking for how to create the new Twitter or the new AirBNB, this page is thin on advice. But there is a lot about innovation and business to business.
